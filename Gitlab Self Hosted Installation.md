# GitLab Self-Hosted Installation  

**Step 1: Download Page**

Go to the download page of “Install self-managed GitLab” by visiting https://about.gitlab.com/install/ 

**Step 2: Get installation instructions for Ubuntu**  

Click on the Ubuntu card to get the instructions.  

**Step 3: Install and configure the necessary dependencies** 

Install and configure the required dependencies 

 sudo apt-get update 
 
 sudo apt-get install -y curl openssh-server ca-certificates tzdata perl 

Next, install Postfix (or Sendmail) to send notification emails. 

**Step 4: Add the GitLab package repository and install the package** 

Add the GitLab package repository and install the package 

curl https://packages.gitlab.com/install/repositories/gitlab/gitlab-ee/script.deb.sh | sudo bash 

**Step 5: Provide DNS URL for GitLab**

sudo EXTERNAL_URL="https://git.osfp.org.pk" apt-get install gitlab-ee 

In case we encounter the following error, then make sure the DNS entry is properly linked with IP address.

It looks like there was a problem with public attributes; run gitlab-ctl reconfigure manually to fix.

**Then following commands will help to resolve.** 
  sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure 
  
  sudo apt-get -f install 
  
  sudo gitlab-ctl status 

**In case of Invalid SSL certificate  following steps can help:**
 GitLab can auto-generate certificates. Ensure letsencrypt['enable'] is set to true in /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb: 

  letsencrypt['enable'] = true 
  
  letsencrypt['contact_emails'] = ['your-email@example.com'] 
  
  external_url "https://git.osfp.org.pk" 

sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure
